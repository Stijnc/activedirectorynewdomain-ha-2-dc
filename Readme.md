# Create a 2 new Windows VMs, create a new AD Forest, Domain and 2 DCs in an availability set

This template will deploy 2 new VMs (along with a new VNet, Storage Account and Load Balancer) and create a new  AD forest and domain, each VM will be created as a DC for the new domain and will be placed in an availability set. Each VM will also have an RDP endpoint added with a public load balanced IP address.

There are a number of issues\workarounds in this template and the associated DSC Script:

1. There is no way (that I can find) to modify a VNet (or any other resource) after it has been created in a template, this template creates a DNS Server and therefore the IP address of that server needs to be specified as a DNS Server in the VNet, however in order for this VM to sucessfully deploy and be configured there needs to be a DNS Server available, this DNS Server is specified as a parameter () ideally we would update the VNet with the IP Address of the new VM once it has been deployed instead. **This value should be provided in the DNSServerAddress parameter, the default value is 8.8.8.8**.

2. Version 1.7 of the DSC Extension has a problem whereby the script execution policy will not allow scripts to be executed , therefore the DSC script provided updates the execution policy before the DSC extension is run and then sets it back to default once the configuration has been applied.

3. There is no way of specifyig dependencies on VM extension resources in templates, therefore the script relies on the DSC confgiuraation for the second VM waiting for the domain created by the DSC configuration in the first VM to become available.

**4. The template deployment may report failure even though the script succeeds**
